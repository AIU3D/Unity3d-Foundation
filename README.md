# Unity3d-Foundation
Databinding, MVVM, Tasks, Localization, Messenger, IOC, and WebApi Client for Unity3d

Bringing modern Microsoft development practices to Unity3d. If you are a Xamarin or WPF developer you might be wondering where the MVVM, databinding, and TPL tools for Unity3d are. They are here. This toolkit bridges the game letting you build higher quality code faster.

If you like this toolkit and want to see a high quality example of the outcome, please support my development by purchasing my premium asset on the asset store. It not only includes a slick, animated UI, but, a complete WebApi back end for support player data.
